Upgrading from older versions
=============================

### From 2.0-RCX to 2.0

You just need to execute
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install galicaster
```

### From 1.x to 2.0
Since Galicaster 1 use Ubuntu 12.04 and Galicaster 2 use Ubuntu 16.04, it's recommendable to install a fresh image of Ubuntu 16.04 and then install Galicaster following the [Software Installation guide](../SoftwareInstallation.md).
