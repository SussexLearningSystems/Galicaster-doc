## Committers

### What is a committer?

The committer role is created to give more tools to experienced and dedicated contributors for supporting the project. With a sufficient level of participation and commitment to the project, contributors may be nominated by existing committers to join the committer body. While similar in day-to-day activities as contributors, the committer role is meant for contributors who have a dedicated interest in supporting the project over the long term.

To facilitate this, committers will share the following privileges:

* Write access to the codebase. (Note: All code contributed by a commiter needs to be reviewed by a different committer, see [Reviewing Rules](ReviewingRules.md) for more information)
* Access to the private committers mailing list.
* Vote on the product design and the project direction.

### Responsibilities of a committer

As a Committer, you have a responsibility to the community to help create a product that will outlive the interest of any particular volunteer (including yourself). This means, for example, that the code that you commit should be clear enough that others not involved in its current development will be able to maintain and extend it. It also means that you are responsible for helping to grow and maintain the health of the Galicaster Community. In short, do the right thing for the project, and use your best judgement above all

The specific responsibilities committers share include:

* Monitor and respond to the mailing list.
* Monitor and vet/triage bugtracker issues.
* Review and commit code contributions.
* Ensuring code contributions adheres to license requirements. Minor patches can be accepted without concern, but the main reviewer must ensure that a CLA (and CCLA) is in place prior to merging in the contribution.
* Maintain the project documentation.
* Guide and mentor new committers.

All committers must sign an ICLA. The privileges and rights of being a committer do not come into effect until an ICLA has been received and processed. The ICLA, as well as the list of ICLA signatories, can be found (here)[Link t ICLA]. Your employer will also need to sign a CCLA as well.

### How do I become a commiter?

Committers must be recommended by existing committers and pass a vote of the committer body. Committers proposing a contributor for commit rights should present a solid background of why this person would be a good fit, as well as their work history within the project. This history, barring special circumstances, should be significant and of a high quality.

### What happens if I stop contributing?

Committer status can be lost through the following actions:

* *Committer Emeritus:* By being absent or inactive for a period of six months or more, or by request, a committer enters emeritus status. No vote is required to enter this state, and committer status can be restored just by making an inquiry to the project infrastructure group. While in emeritus, committers lose access to project resources, as well as lose the ability to vote and engage in discussion on the committers mailing list.

* *Revocation of Commit Privileges:* A committer may make a proposal to remove an individual from the committer body. Discussion and voting happen on the confidential committers mailing list, and the committer in question is not entitled to a vote (though they can participate in the discussion).
